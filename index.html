			<h3>First Day. Plans for Future.</h3>

			<p>Today I set up my website in a way so I can post everytime I edit my code. Super happy because I can now put new entries into this website with ease. In the future I plan on placing this website on a seperate website by itself. This will be good because then I just give updates there as I work on my porjects for the website. I have some plans including making a "How to Solve a Rubiks Cube" tutorial. That'll hopefully be a lot of fun to do.I am planning on finding a way to do some simple Rubiks Cube animations. This way people can see the cube turning and see what they have to do. Also I want to extend the tutorial so that it teaches people how to read algorythmns. If I really want to, I can provide all the algorythmns for the Rubiks Cube and maybe set up a system so people can talk and chat about techniques. Also might start programing simple videogames. I would really love to work on my own version of Tetris. We'll see what happens from then on.</p>
			<p>I was going to edit on GitHub but I found that their servers really took a while to proccess my code and after a frustrating session, I decided to use the terminal to program. The way I did this (in case you want to do so as well) is that I opened a file using VIM. Then I 'coded' the code for the website on that document. And to run the code I would go to Google Chrome and CTRL + O. This would bring up a meneu and I would select my file and then open it using Chrome. Worth to mention that I have a Linux based PC and I can easily use the terminal. Also my text editor is VIM. I would take the code from the file on my PC and just Copy-Paste it into GitHub. Long post, so might as well wrap it up for right now.</p>

			<p>Today I just found out a tiny but of how machines learn and improve. To the best of my knowledge this is how it works. Of course this is a very simple version of what I heard. The way I think about it is that humans develope programs to make another program randomly. The other program is that the machines make has a completely random way of producing inputs to outputs. Then you import a bunch of questions that a human con tell the programs the answer but can tell them if they are right or wrong. Then the prgrams that get the most questions right are then improved randomly. You have a program quessing why they got the questions wrong, they themselves are just guessing. The ones that got it wrong just deleted and a new random program takes it's place. This goes on forever until you can get programs to get every single question right, consistently. The people who made the programs don't know how they operate but they do and they do so correctly. Remeber that this is a very simple version of what I understood of how machines learned. It's proabbly wrongs.</p>

			<p>After discovering more information about machine learning, I have learned several other ways to go about it. Though I do have to questions. One of which is that after the first wave of bots try and acomplish a task, does the your AI program take the 'best' bot and and make random changes to in the form of a bunch more new bots? I think this will make sense. My further understanding of AI though is basic trial and error. Bots try to do a task and based on how well they do it they can build nueron networks and pathways to accociate what is good and bad. For example, a mouse eating cheese through a maze with cats in it. The mouse will soon asociate cats with bad stuff and now touch cats. This is found through trial and error. Kinda almost mimicking evolustion. The smart carry on and the weak die.</p>
			<p>Now that I have learned a little of AI, I have come to a massive comclusion. AI is the future. The abilty for computers to learn has endless possibilities and use cases. Computers are way faster at doing computations than humans and using that to an advatage is huge, espcially with AI. Because of this conclusion, though, I really want to get my hands wet with experimenting with AI. I already know how to code simple websites, such as this,and Python but what I really need to know hardcore Computer Science. I need to know how to use fast languages, such as C++, and really learn ways of coding and how to do so efficiently. In order to do this I need to dive into this C++ book I have right in front of me and learn the programs. I need to learn the all the arrays, pointers, functions that come with the book. This will enable me to more easily try and learn more AI. I will also help program tenfold better. So as of today, I am going to be diving strait into Computer Science using C++. Of course I need to pace myself so it won't be a massive crash course. I want to retain this knowledge and that might mean going at a slow speed and understanding everything. Long post again, time to start learning!</p>

			<h3>Plans For Summer</h3>

			<p>So I has been two months since my last post. A little upsetting because it has been so long. But during this summer I would love to post way more often, probably atleast once a day dring this summer. I have jumped straight into coding again in the past couple of day. As I was flipping through the terminal, I saw this file and decided that it needs an update because it has been a while.</p>
			<p>So lately I have kinda been practicing a little JavaScript. I find JavaScript fun because then I could program some games with it in the future. JS for me right now is a more fun format I can code in. I am still learning all there is to coding as I am not satisified with the amount I know right now. I am still learning to program a in C++. C++ is the language where I am learning all the basic programming fundimentals. Since it is a little more strict on what you can do, it forces you to do things correct and properly. Also I have a massive book about it and there is tons of information to be learned.</p>
			<p>I do have a class the first couple weeks of summer so my time learning might be cut down a little bit, but probably not too much. I am excited to learn a lot more of Computer Science. My goals right now for the summer is to finish my 1000+ page book on C++. It'll be about 25 pages perday so it should seem pretty manageable. I'll be spending a couple hours doing that everyday and then finish off my day updating this website and adding a post. Excited for what's ahead of me.</p>

			<p>Today I recently discovered Sublime Text Editor. I finished installing it into the terminal, then fired it up. I soon found out all the ways to edit it and now coding has never been so fun. I have programming in JavaScript instead of C++ because I found it more fun. One of the reasons why I found it so much fun was because of its simplicity compared to C++. But now after programming in Sublime a little in C++ I am finding way more fun than JavaScript. I have only done a couple hours but lately it has been an awesome experience. To be honest I am a little upset that I have to go to sleep right now.</p>
			<p>Since this last motivation, I really want to just hurry up and finish this book on C++. This way I could go and start working a big programs that are actulally useful. I am definitely going to finish reading this book. Also, lately I have seeon that my typing skills could do with some work. So now I have been working on typing faster so I can program faster. I am extremely motivated right now to code. Also I am thinking of uploading my projects to my GitHub repositories.</p>

		<p>These past couple days I have worked on a couple different projects. Two of which were some C++ projects. The first one was for my little sister. She's in the past enjoyed a lot of math so I decided to create a fun math game for her. I generated random equations for her to answer. I soon learned that some of them were '17 * 8'. So as a result I subtracted the first number by ten for multiplication problems. This made it easier for her. This code can be found in my Cpp-Projects repository here on GitHub. A link can be found on top of my this website.</p>

<p>My next project that I worked on was a sorting algorthymn. My end goal was to generate 100 random numbers into an array, then sort them from 1 - 100. At first I wanted it to be simple so I generated 5 random numbers and tried to sort them. I still found this difficult to work with, I just made 5 random numbers so I know what I was working with. I Googled sorting numbers and found a library that sorts them for you. But I felt that learning this library would be a little too simple and that first I had to do it by hand. So after that I found a video that compared the first number to the second number and swapped them if it was greater. I stopped the video there I can solve the rest. I created solution, but I found that if a low was all the way at the end, it would have to take the entire array to pull that number from the far right to far left. I ran this code and found success. Then I wondered about effeincy. So I added a few lines of code to find the effeicy of my program. Again, this code can be accessed in my Cpp-Projects Repository</p>

		<h3>Transition</h3>

	<article class="body">
		<p>I haven't posted in a long month. Partly is due to my summer class that I have been taking. But now that is all over, I can finally providean update. I have been working on several projects lately. I have purchased a book on Genetic Algorythmns, and Simulation in C/C++. Having learned a lot form that book, I created a dead simple genetic alorythmn myself. This alg involves populating a new populations, deciding whose most fit, electing top 2 most fit individuals, producing a child, populating a new population with parents and child, and allowing very mutation. This process, as you would assume, repeats untill I have completed my taks. For my simple example, my task was to produce 14 characters that are randomly 1 and 0's and eventually turn them all into just 1's. I produced 6 individuals for every population, and using the steps described before, I accomplished my goal of turing them all into 1's</p>
		<p>My next thing I began working on was a visual sorter for a sorting algorythmn. Basically, it provides a chart table environment where you can see a sorter work live. So do this I had to discover two new things that I could do with my terminal display. One is to be able to clear the screen. I did this using <b>system("clear")</b> command. This would clear my entire terminal screen. The second thing I had to find out was how to put in a slight delay on the terminal so you can see animations, rather than having the animation process so fast that, you can't see it. I did this by including a library called <b><unistd.h></b> and this library had a function called <b>usleep(time)</b> and time would be how many seconds you would like to pause the program.</p>
		<p>After figuring out these to new commands, I realized that while making visual games is possible, it just isn't as efficient as it could be. Also, it would never be as clean and as visual as making a pop-up window. So that's when I started to search the internet for a way to produce a window in C++ and draw to it, load images to it, render it, and plenty of other stuff. Soon enough I came upon <b>SDL2</b>, and I was estatic. SDL2 is a relatively simple way to build programs in a window using C++. I have been using a website (Foo Productions) to help teach my how to work with SDL2. Upon discovering that, a little while later I found another 'program' that could help me. This is called <b>OpenGL</b> and from my understanding so far, it allow you do powerfull graphics rendering. I learned SDL2 has really tried hard to make it easy to use SDL2 and OpenGL together in unison. So using these to 'programs' will help me get what I want</p>
		<p>Lastly as a final note, I will be uploading most of the code I can with SDL2. I plan to learn OpenGL after SDL2. As a result, it might take a while to get some OpenGL running. I am programming a lot right now in SDL2, but the reason you might see alot in my repository is because I am following along with the website and I am building programs along with the website. This is problamatic becauase it isn't really <b>my</b> code, but code I wrote following and minicking his code. For this reason I can't put it to GitHub and claim it as mine, but soon enough I well get some of my unique programs running after I learn a bit more of SDL2. This has been a long one post due me not posting frequently, but rest assured I am still programming.</p>

		<h3><b>Push</b> Onwards</h3>

		<p>WHOA! So I have been lately up to a lot of work. I have already published my projects with SDL2. I have also been drilling through a lot of C++ material and some basic programming skills. I learned and used classes, constructors, deconstuctors, and enums. Just implementing some simple classes into my programs is already making my programs so much more easier to work in. I found that classes really help organizing your code. The same goes with enums aswell. From what I have found, enums are really just used to help make programs a lot easier to read.</p>
		<p>For SDL, I have made some simple games that extremely fun to program. I used to love making simple games in the terminal prompt screen, but I soon found out that if I wanted to take my prgrams to another level, that I would have to start venturing into some sort of graphical interface. That is exactly what SDL2 has allowed me to do. But now I want ot share my games so others (my friends) can play them to. So I see that the next step is to start learning JavaScript and learning how to make that interact with an HTML canvas. This way me and friends can just fire up my website, enter a code or something and we could be playing my games (just Tic-Tac-Toe and Mega-Tic-Tac-Toe for now).So that is definitly on my radar for the next couple months.</p>
		<p>School is out! Because of this, I have found that my free time to do any work on my computer is completely out of question during the week days. I am doing a sport so along with the seven hours schools takes, I have to devote another couple or so hours to my sport. I need to work hard to mantain my A's in my classes, so by the time I finish all my homework, it is already like 9pm or 9:30, and I need to go to sleep. On the bright-side, I have weekends to work on my computer, so I can usually finish and handfull of programs. For example, this weekend is Labor Day weekend so I have an entire extra day to work. As for spending any time on a device or a phone, I have completely cut that off. From my exerpience, the phone (other for calling or texting) is entirely just a waste of time that I could be spending doing other more important things. After cutting that off for the past two or so months, I have found myself with so much extra time and way more happy.</p>

      <h3>Busy!</h3>

      <p>The past few months have been very busy for me. But my venture to continue to program has not been shut down! I have been putting the hours in on weekdays, weekends and where ever I can find the time.So one of my main goals that I have been working on lately is learning Java. There are a couple reasons why I wanted to learn Java. One large reason is because of its massive versatilty. Java, as I have found, is used almost anywhere. Where it be from PCs to small PIs, Java is widely used and I can see why. Due to Java having such a massive community, Java has developed large stucture of <b>methods</b> and objects that are used to do just about everything. You can perform many tasks with these structures, you can also make games, which leads into my next reason to learn Java. Java has some 'easy' ways for peopole to <b>import</b> some libraies so you can begin <b>Game Developement</b>. This is another reason, no quite as important, to learn Java. I loved the idea about getting involved in a high level video game program that I can evolve over time. This has also peaked my interest for Java. One of the last reasons for me to learn Java is because it is the language the <b>College Board</b> has decided to use for the <b>AP Computer Science a</b> test. This test is important to me because it will show to others that I can program and it will also test me to make sure that I am comfortable with the topic.</p>
	    <p>I addition to <b>Game Developement</b> being important to me, I have discovered new "languages" that can help me do this. The reason why I used "" for languages is because they mostly consist of 'frameworks' built around languages. One thing I have looked into and would like to advance with is p5.js. I think this interesting because they developers of p5 have really worked hard to help beginners get into programming through their library. This library is probably one of my favorites due it being centered around JavaScript. This means that I can embed code into websites to share my games with other people. Another very similar 'framework' to p5.js is Processing. Processing is a little more simple I feel,but due to mylack of knowledge of them both, it is hard for me to determine which one I like better. I have a feeling the Processing is more powerful just because is centered around Java which very quick. But what I do not like about it is that Processing is very specialized, meaning that I don't see any obvious ways I could share my games with others. p5.js is way more global which I like more, as I said.</p>

      <p>These past months I have been much more focused into Computer Science. I have transitioned from making a lot of coding projects into learning more advanced concepts. I have purchased a book about machine learning with Python. I have also started to study more for my Computer Science A final on May 8. I have also been colaborating with a couple of my friends about large projects. One project is to flip pages for pianist  automatically. This will be implented with 3D printed parts, a motor, a board, and a pedal that the musician presses. This is big project that I working with right now. Me and my buddy have already recieved some money through crowd funding. I have also met with another friend who has a lot of experience bulding and making nueral networks. I spent 10+ hours talking with him about AI and the actual math behind it. Mind, we are both in Pre-Calculus at the moment, so he taught me dirrivites. He invited to his company Affix which will help users create severs locally and be able to have their friends link up. It is a very good idea and I feel like we could have a strong relationship. So far me and him are the only people inside of his company.</p>
	    <p>Next line of buisness that I have been working on is creating a MarchingBandFieldEditor for my band director. Back in September he would pass out papers and distrubute them to the students. But on the field it was very difficuly to be able to read the sheets and I felt the band was wasting hours just sitting on the ground trying to understand what the paper was saying. I saw this issue and avetually asked him if he wanted me to make a program that can make neat and simple directions for the students. He loved the idea and so I began with it and finished in about 25hours or so. It is now complete and uploaded to my GitGub repositories. My goal with project is to help bands make clean and neat instructions for their field shows without having to learn a really complicated program. This is because my director told me that he tried to learn one the programs but just found it way to complicated. I posed to fixed that and hopefully I accomplished both issues. It is written in Java using a framework called Processing. I encourage everyone to install Processing and my source code and run it. I think it is packed with features but also very simple. I am really proud of my result</p>

      <h3>Progress and Change <b>Rust!</b></h3>

    <article class="body">
       <p>Hello. So I have made a lot of progresss with my programming in the last past couple of months. I made my last edit at the start of the Cornan Virus epidemic where everythings was undecided. I had no idea that I would still be feeling the effects of the virus all the way until today and possilbly for the rest of the 2020 year. I just wanted to say in this post that I have completed my AP Computer Science A test and am very proud to have scored a 4. Although I did dream of a 5, a 4 is still something to be proud of. Looking back I know that I could have studied a little more for the test as I mostly went into the test with basic programming knowledge. During this summer I have bene coming back to things that I have been wanting to do for a long time. One of those things is study for the SAT. I have started studying today and will devoting a lot of hours to the test preperation.</p>
       <p>Something that I am very happy to begin learning is <b>Rust!</b>. I have been looking at Rust and personally see a lot of potential in the language. Right now it seems like it is only being used as a system language, but honestly I see that I could become some sort of multi-purpose language that C++ has evovled into. The reason that I am learning Rust is because I am trying to write a Neural Network API using it. Me and a friend of mine (Jake Harrison) are both working together in a company that we just started called Affix. Here we are posting peices of software that hopefully the average person can use. I have learned Neural Networks from him and am helping making the API available to come in Rust. It is originally written in C# but Jake has converted it to C++ and now I am trying to make it into Rust. This will just provide compatibilty for many languages. Also we would also like to incorperate it into Python as some sort of wrapper. I hopefully will be heading that project because I find it really interesting.</p>
       <p>Another thing I am trying to do again is re-write my Marching Band Editor into a super powerful crosslanguage peice of software that anyone can intuitively use. This is designed for my band director because as I have previously said he was really struggling to use Pyware. In my opinion that is not acceptable and I have taken the task to revise my vision of a powerful program. I should hopefully finish this project by the end of this year and if I really squeeze it in I want it done by the end of this summer. But good code takes time and I want to be able to add new features in the future so I can not get it to be spagetti code. I also have been in contact with my local university and I am planning on skipping their beginers course. This will be done by using my AP Computer Science A score to get out of the first intro class. I am also planning in the future to more courses which is why this summer I took a Discrete Structures class at a community college so I can pass the prerequisuite without having to take their class. Since I am a highschool student I do not take priority over college students for these classes which means that if a class fills up, it will be extremely difficult to take the class. The Discrete Mathematics course at my local college is usually very filled so in order to save myself a headache I will just take this class instead. All is going well and the end of the term is next week. As of right now I have an A which is a passing grade which is also really good. Very excited to tackle these projects that I have made for myself this summer!</p>
