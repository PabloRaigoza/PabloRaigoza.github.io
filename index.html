			<p>Today I set up my website in a way so I can post everytime I edit my code. Super happy because I can now put new entries into this website with ease. In the future I plan on placing this website on a seperate website by itself. This will be good because then I just give updates there as I work on my porjects for the website. I have some plans including making a "How to Solve a Rubiks Cube" tutorial. That'll hopefully be a lot of fun to do.I am planning on finding a way to do some simple Rubiks Cube animations. This way people can see the cube turning and see what they have to do. Also I want to extend the tutorial so that it teaches people how to read algorythmns. If I really want to, I can provide all the algorythmns for the Rubiks Cube and maybe set up a system so people can talk and chat about techniques. Also might start programing simple videogames. I would really love to work on my own version of Tetris. We'll see what happens from then on.</p>
			<p>I was going to edit on GitHub but I found that their servers really took a while to proccess my code and after a frustrating session, I decided to use the terminal to program. The way I did this (in case you want to do so as well) is that I opened a file using VIM. Then I 'coded' the code for the website on that document. And to run the code I would go to Google Chrome and CTRL + O. This would bring up a meneu and I would select my file and then open it using Chrome. Worth to mention that I have a Linux based PC and I can easily use the terminal. Also my text editor is VIM. I would take the code from the file on my PC and just Copy-Paste it into GitHub. Long post, so might as well wrap it up for right now.</p>

			<h3>Machine Learning</h3>

			<p>Today I just found out a tiny but of how machines learn and improve. To the best of my knowledge this is how it works. Of course this is a very simple version of what I heard. The way I think about it is that humans develope programs to make another program randomly. The other program is that the machines make has a completely random way of producing inputs to outputs. Then you import a bunch of questions that a human con tell the programs the answer but can tell them if they are right or wrong. Then the prgrams that get the most questions right are then improved randomly. You have a program quessing why they got the questions wrong, they themselves are just guessing. The ones that got it wrong just deleted and a new random program takes it's place. This goes on forever until you can get programs to get every single question right, consistently. The people who made the programs don't know how they operate but they do and they do so correctly. Remeber that this is a very simple version of what I understood of how machines learned. It's proabbly wrongs.</p>

			<h3>Path for Learning the Future.</h3>

			<p>After discovering more information about machine learning, I have learned several other ways to go about it. Though I do have to questions. One of which is that after the first wave of bots try and acomplish a task, does the your AI program take the 'best' bot and and make random changes to in the form of a bunch more new bots? I think this will make sense. My further understanding of AI though is basic trial and error. Bots try to do a task and based on how well they do it they can build nueron networks and pathways to accociate what is good and bad. For example, a mouse eating cheese through a maze with cats in it. The mouse will soon asociate cats with bad stuff and now touch cats. This is found through trial and error. Kinda almost mimicking evolustion. The smart carry on and the weak die.</p>
			<p>Now that I have learned a little of AI, I have come to a massive comclusion. AI is the future. The abilty for computers to learn has endless possibilities and use cases. Computers are way faster at doing computations than humans and using that to an advatage is huge, espcially with AI. Because of this conclusion, though, I really want to get my hands wet with experimenting with AI. I already know how to code simple websites, such as this,and Python but what I really need to know hardcore Computer Science. I need to know how to use fast languages, such as C++, and really learn ways of coding and how to do so efficiently. In order to do this I need to dive into this C++ book I have right in front of me and learn the programs. I need to learn the all the arrays, pointers, functions that come with the book. This will enable me to more easily try and learn more AI. I will also help program tenfold better. So as of today, I am going to be diving strait into Computer Science using C++. Of course I need to pace myself so it won't be a massive crash course. I want to retain this knowledge and that might mean going at a slow speed and understanding everything. Long post again, time to start learning!</p>

			<h3>Plans For Summer</h3>

			<p>So I has been two months since my last post. A little upsetting because it has been so long. But during this summer I would love to post way more often, probably atleast once a day dring this summer. I have jumped straight into coding again in the past couple of day. As I was flipping through the terminal, I saw this file and decided that it needs an update because it has been a while.</p>
			<p>So lately I have kinda been practicing a little JavaScript. I find JavaScript fun because then I could program some games with it in the future. JS for me right now is a more fun format I can code in. I am still learning all there is to coding as I am not satisified with the amount I know right now. I am still learning to program a in C++. C++ is the language where I am learning all the basic programming fundimentals. Since it is a little more strict on what you can do, it forces you to do things correct and properly. Also I have a massive book about it and there is tons of information to be learned.</p>
			<p>I do have a class the first couple weeks of summer so my time learning might be cut down a little bit, but probably not too much. I am excited to learn a lot more of Computer Science. My goals right now for the summer is to finish my 1000+ page book on C++. It'll be about 25 pages perday so it should seem pretty manageable. I'll be spending a couple hours doing that everyday and then finish off my day updating this website and adding a post. Excited for what's ahead of me.</p>

			<h3>Motivated</h3>

			<p>Today I recently discovered Sublime Text Editor. I finished installing it into the terminal, then fired it up. I soon found out all the ways to edit it and now coding has never been so fun. I have programming in JavaScript instead of C++ because I found it more fun. One of the reasons why I found it so much fun was because of its simplicity compared to C++. But now after programming in Sublime a little in C++ I am finding way more fun than JavaScript. I have only done a couple hours but lately it has been an awesome experience. To be honest I am a little upset that I have to go to sleep right now.</p>
			<p>Since this last motivation, I really want to just hurry up and finish this book on C++. This way I could go and start working a big programs that are actulally useful. I am definitely going to finish reading this book. Also, lately I have seen that my typing skills could do with some work. So now I have been working on typing faster so I can program faster. I am extremely motivated right now to code. Also I am thinking of uploading my projects to my GitHub repositories.</p>

      <p>These past couple days I have worked on a couple different projects. Two of which were some C++ projects. The first one was for my little sister. She's in the past enjoyed a lot of math so I decided to create a fun math game for her. I generated random equations for her to answer. I soon learned that some of them were '17 * 8'. So as a result I subtracted the first number by ten for multiplication problems. This made it easier for her. This code can be found in my Cpp-Projects repository here on GitHub. A link can be found on top of my this website.</p>
      <p>My next project that I worked on was a sorting algorthymn. My end goal was to generate 100 random numbers into an array, then sort them from 1 - 100. At first I wanted it to be simple so I generated 5 random numbers and tried to sort them. I still found this difficult to work with, I just made 5 random numbers so I know what I was working with. I Googled sorting numbers and found a library that sorts them for you. But I felt that learning this library would be a little too simple and that first I had to do it by hand. So after that I found a video that compared the first number to the second number and swapped them if it was greater. I stopped the video there I can solve the rest. I created solution, but I found that if a low was all the way at the end, it would have to take the entire array to pull that number from the far right to far left. I ran this code and found success. Then I wondered about effeincy. So I added a few lines of code to find the effeicy of my program. Again, this code can be accessed in my Cpp-Projects repository.</p>
