Today I set up my website in a way so I can post everytime I edit my code. Super happy because I can now put new entries into this website with ease. In the future I plan on placing this website on a seperate website by itself. This will be good because then I just give updates there as I work on my porjects for the website. I have some plans including making a "How to Solve a Rubiks Cube" tutorial. That'll hopefully be a lot of fun to do.I am planning on finding a way to do some simple Rubiks Cube animations. This way people can see the cube turning and see what they have to do. Also I want to extend the tutorial so that it teaches people how to read algorythmns. If I really want to, I can provide all the algorythmns for the Rubiks Cube and maybe set up a system so people can talk and chat about techniques. Also might start programing simple videogames. I would really love to work on my own version of Tetris. We'll see what happens from then on.

I was going to edit on GitHub but I found that their servers really took a while to proccess my code and after a frustrating session, I decided to use the terminal to program. The way I did this (in case you want to do so as well) is that I opened a file using VIM. Then I 'coded' the code for the website on that document. And to run the code I would go to Google Chrome and CTRL + O. This would bring up a meneu and I would select my file and then open it using Chrome. Worth to mention that I have a Linux based PC and I can easily use the terminal. Also my text editor is VIM. I would take the code from the file on my PC and just Copy-Paste it into GitHub. Long post, so might as well wrap it up for right now.
