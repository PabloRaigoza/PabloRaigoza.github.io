These past couple days I have worked on a couple different projects. Two of which were some C++ projects. The first one was for my little sister. She's in the past enjoyed a lot of math so I decided to create a fun math game for her. I generated random equations for her to answer. I soon learned that some of them were '17 * 8'. So as a result I subtracted the first number by ten for multiplication problems. This made it easier for her. This code can be found in my Cpp-Projects repository here on GitHub. A link can be found on top of my this website.

My next project that I worked on was a sorting algorthymn. My end goal was to generate 100 random numbers into an array, then sort them from 1 - 100. At first I wanted it to be simple so I generated 5 random numbers and tried to sort them. I still found this difficult to work with, I just made 5 random numbers so I know what I was working with. I Googled sorting numbers and found a library that sorts them for you. But I felt that learning this library would be a little too simple and that first I had to do it by hand. So after that I found a video that compared the first number to the second number and swapped them if it was greater. I stopped the video there I can solve the rest. I created solution, but I found that if a low was all the way at the end, it would have to take the entire array to pull that number from the far right to far left. I ran this code and found success. Then I wondered about effeincy. So I added a few lines of code to find the effeicy of my program. Again, this code can be accessed in my Cpp-Projects Repository
