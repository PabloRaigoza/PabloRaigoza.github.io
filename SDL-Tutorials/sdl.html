		<p>These set of tutorials are set to offer help others learn SDL.
		<br><br>
		The very first step to learning SDL is go ahead and download the library from the their website. The link is here: 
			<a href="http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php">Lazy Foo'</a>
		. I would suggest to go look at those tutorials as well, but I found that Lazy Foo' did a nice job at providing download information for the three primary OS. Windows, Mac, and Linux <i>(cough...the best OS... cough)</i>.
		<br><br>
			As a little heads up before the lessons. These lesson are intened for programmers who are comfortable <b>C++</b> and <b>C</b>. This means you can easily create classes, use constuctors, have a firm understanding of data types, and probably most important, you understand completely how to use functions and how to create them.
		<br><br>
			I to am learning more and more of SDL and the basics of Computer Science, so I might some mistakes here and there but hopefully the message can still get across with SDL
		</p>
		<p>
			In most of these tutorials I will be using information, charts, and references to the <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/APIByCategory">SDL 2.0 Wiki</a>.
